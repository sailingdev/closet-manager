# Closetr
### What it is
Closetr is a closet tracker that helps you have a better sense of your style,
and spending. We want to make it easier to know what to wear next, and to give
you insight on which clothes work (and don't work) for you.
### Why we made this
#### ... a tool that we needed.
Our team is two people who have different relationships with personal style, as
well as different approaches to maintaining each of our closets.

Closetr is meant to help with organizing your closet, whether you have too much
or too little. We provide insights and simple analytics that help you make your
next decisions: be it purchases, what to wear today, or what you might need to
discard. We made this tool to help us, and hopefully it helps you too!
#### ... a project to help us learn.
We also wanted to get started on a project together and learn how to build a
web application with a new stack we have no previous experience on.
